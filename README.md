Project for trading cryptocurrency pairs through Robinhood using the robin_stocks python API and the talib python API.  It currently decides on positions using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) technical indicator (https://www.investopedia.com/trading/macd/), deciding to hold a specific position if the MACD line is both above 0 and above the MACD trigger line.
